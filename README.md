#Password generator

    I created this password generator as part of the #100days100projects challenge

#Live demo

[Live demo of the app](https://bysiuxvx.github.io/password-generator/)

#Technologies used

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript

#Things I learned

    I used to put all characters in a variable like in example:

        var letters: [ABCDEFGH]
        var numbers: [12489372489023]

    And this is how I coded this app in the beginning too, but I found out a better
     and more efficient way by using the String method for letters, or +String for numbers.
    I still had to keep the symbols in a variable, because to my knowledge there was
    no other way to generate those.
